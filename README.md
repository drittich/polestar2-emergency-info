# Polestar Emergency Info

Various bits of useful information for when something goes wrong.

## Polestar Customer Support & Roadside Assistance

To contact Roadside Assistance using Polestar Connect, press the black ‘CONNECT’ button in the ceiling console. Toll free numbers can be found at [https://www.polestar.com/en/service-and-assistance/roadside-assistance/](https://www.polestar.com/en/service-and-assistance/roadside-assistance/).

## Infotainment Reset

Hold down the home button until the display goes completely black. It will reboot after about 10 - 20 seconds.

## TCAM Reset

The TCAM is the telecommunications module that provides network and radio services for Internet (3G/4G/LTE), Wifi, GPS, Bluetooth, and keys. If any of these features are malfunctioning, you can try to reset your TCAM:

1. Stop the car and make sure it's in park.
2. Hold HOME button on the main screen until it does a reset of the infotainment system (see above).
3. Immediately after the reboot has finished, hold down the front window demist button (the one next to the play/pause button with a curved windscreen shape ... in a right hand drive car this is to the left of play/pause) for at least 15 seconds.
4. Wait patiently a few seconds until the SOS starts flashing.

## Silence Car Alarm

Place a key fob (not the activity key) into the cupholder under the central arm rest.

## Google Assistant Reset

You can re-initialize the Google Assistant by clearing the app's storage. You do this by following these steps: 

`Settings -> Apps & Notifications -> Show all Apps -> Google Assistant -> Storage & Cache -> Clear storage`

## Propulsion System Errors

Lock the car and leave it for about 30 minutes, staying far enough away that it does not detect the key. This is often enough to make the car driveable again.

## Battery Boost

1. Put the vehicle's electrical system in Passive usage mode.
2. Make sure the assisting battery has a voltage of 12V.
3. If the battery is in another vehicle, turn off that vehicle's engine and make sure that the vehicles are not touching each other.
4. Clamp one end of the red jumper cable onto the assisting battery's positive terminal, often marked in red or with a plus sign (+).
5. Open the cover over the positive charging point by pressing in its side to release the catch while lifting the cover upward. There are two charging points under the cover. Use the one closest to the center of the vehicle.
6. Clamp the other end of the red jumper cable to the positive charging point.
7. Clamp one end of the black jumper cable onto the assisting battery's negative terminal, often marked in black or with a minus sign (-).
8. Clamp the other end of the black jumper cable to your vehicle's negative charging point. Because the vehicle's chassis serves as ground for the 12 V system, the bolt head marked in the illustration can be used.
9. Make sure the jumper cables are securely attached to help prevent sparks while jump starting.
10. Start the engine of the assisting vehicle.
11. Start the vehicle with the discharged battery by depressing the brake pedal and selecting gear position D or R.
12. If the high-voltage battery is also discharged, begin charging of the vehicle using the charging cable.
13. Remove the jumper cables in the reverse order ‒ first the black cables and then the red cables.

Make sure that none of the clamps of the black jumper cables come into contact with the vehicle's positive charging point, the assisting battery's positive terminal or either of the red jumper cable's connected clamps.

## Enable Tow Mode

1. Tap the car symbol in the center display.
2. Tap More.
3. Tap Car status.
4. Tap Service.
5. Select Tow Mode.
6. Follow the instructions on the screen.

The vehicle is now in tow mode and can roll freely.

## Manual Charge Cable Release (Level 1 or 2 only!)

If the lock motor fails to release during level 1 or 2 charging, the cable can be removed through a manual actuation of the lock motor. To release the cable:
1. Use a T30 torx or blunt screwdriver and gently depress the cable lock motor located on the top of the charging
cable connector.
2. Once the motor is released, press the cable lock lever and remove the charge cable from the vehicle.
