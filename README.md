## Infotainment Reset Procedure

Hold down the home button until the display goes completely black. It will reboot after about 10 - 20 seconds

## TCAM Reset Procedure

1. Stop the car. Make sure in park.
2. Hold HOME button on main screen until it does a reset of the infotainment system.
3. Immediately after the reboot has finished, hold down the front window demist button (the one next to the play/pause button with a curved windscreen shape ... in a right hand drive car this is to the left of play/pause) for at least 15 seconds.
4. Note: I was counting slowly and got to 30 seconds without an SOS light flashing, before the CS person said to me that’s enough, let go.
5. Wait patiently a few seconds and hey presto the SoS started flashing. Note it did not start flashing until I had release the button and waited a while.
6. Once flashing stops, after about another 10-15s the 4G/LTE display started changing. For me it flickered from 4G to LTE, then the empty strength signal changed to full, and then the ‘x’ disappeared and I had full connectivity.

## Enable Tow Mode Procedure

1. Tap the car symbol in the center display.
2. Tap More.
3. Tap Car status.
4. Tap Service.
5. Select Tow Mode.
6. Follow the instructions on the screen.

The vehicle is now in tow mode and can roll freely.

## Battery Boost Procedure

1. Put the vehicle's electrical system in Passive usage mode.
2. Make sure the assisting battery has a voltage of 12 V.
3. If the battery is in another vehicle, turn off that vehicle's engine and make sure that the vehicles are not touching each other.
4. Clamp one end of the red jumper cable onto the assisting battery's positive terminal, often marked in red or with a plus sign (+).
5. Open the cover over the positive charging point by pressing in its side to release the catch while lifting the cover upward. There are two charging points under the cover. Use the one closest to the center of the vehicle.
6. Clamp the other end of the red jumper cable to the positive charging point.
7. Clamp one end of the black jumper cable onto the assisting battery's negative terminal, often marked in black or with a minus sign (-).
8. Clamp the other end of the black jumper cable to your vehicle's negative charging point. Because the vehicle's chassis serves as ground for the 12 V system, the bolt head marked in the illustration can be used.
9. Make sure the jumper cables are securely attached to help prevent sparks while jump starting.
10. Start the engine of the assisting vehicle.
11. Start the vehicle with the discharged battery by depressing the brake pedal and selecting gear position D or R.
12. If the high-voltage battery is also discharged, begin charging of the vehicle using the charging cable.
13. Remove the jumper cables in the reverse order ‒ first the black cables and then the red cables.

Make sure that none of the clamps of the black jumper cables come into contact with the vehicle's positive charging point, the assisting battery's positive terminal or either of the red jumper cable's connected clamps.
